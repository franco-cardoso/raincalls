                USER, ON HER/HIS BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF THE ENTITY THAT SHE/HE REPRESENTS, HEREBY RELEASES COMPANY FROM
                ANY AND ALL OBLIGATIONS, LIABILITIES AND CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF THE LIMITATIONS STATED HEREIN. IF
                APPLICABLE LAW DOES NOT PERMIT SUCH LIMITATIONS, THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF COMPANY TO ANY USER AND/OR
                ENTITY UNDER ANY AND ALL CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($500.00). NO ACTION, REGARDLESS OF
                FORM, ARISING OUT OF THE COMPANY OFFERINGS AND/OR ANY OTHER PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES OFFERED BY AND/OR
                THROUGH SAME, MAY BE BROUGHT BY ANY USER, ENTITY OR COMPANY MORE THAN ONE (1) YEAR FOLLOWING THE EVENT
                WHICH GAVE RISE TO THE CAUSE OF ACTION. THE NEGATION OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE IS A FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT
                OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN EACH USER, ENTITY AND COMPANY. ACCESS TO THE COMPANY OFFERINGS WOULD
                NOT BE PROVIDED TO ANY USERS AND/OR ENTITIES WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
                CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY AND IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS THE LIABILITY OF COMPANY SHALL BE LIMITED TO
                THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</span
